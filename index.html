                                Really good tradesman. We have had a number of workers help with the renovation of our house, these guys genuinely stood out. Real care and attention was put into the work they did and we felt at ease with them in our home. We would definitely like to get them back to do further work in the future. Many thanks!<br><br>

                                Highly recommended. Flexible and very well priced. Certainly would use again and recommend to anyone undertaking a small or large job. Flexibility and price were key for me, both were delivered on. Expert design and has transformed my flat.

                                Great guys. Came on time and performed the task quickly and well. They even offered to come back the following day to complete when we realised we didn't have the requisite parts, with no additional charge. Very happy customer!

                                I chose Jarex as he was able to start straight away and very reasonably priced for the work we needed. They were very polite an conscientious when in our home, they did the job to a very high standard and we cannot thank them enough for transforming our new home which we moved into 4 weeks ago. Jarek had very good communication and would often let me know if he was running 5 minutes late. They helped with the right colours for the home and to preserve light which was important to me. I would highly recommend these guys and we have kept their business card for the future.

                                Very very good service. If I could give them a score out of 10 it would be 10. Polite and courteous from start to finish for the full 3 weeks! They were real perfectionists and did the job to a very high standard. Taking out an old fire place painting all skirting shelves walls and doors 4 bed house and fitting 42sm of flooring. Every problem was overcome with can do attitude. All our house stuff was looked after by great preparation. They tidyed up every evening so we could still use the house through the decorating. Great lads can't speak highly enough!

                                I am absolutely delighted with our newly restored front door. Jarek and Patryk are incredibly good people and really do take great care and attention. They arrived on time every day, were polite, cleaned up after themselves and offered suggestions as to the job based on their expertise. There were a couple of extras I didn’t include in the original work description and they managed to complete them as well. They are perfectionists and when it comes to jobs like these I think that’s really important - they stayed later than planned just to make sure the door was perfect. If I ever have any more restoration / paint jobs then I will be calling INDEEX for sure. Thank you so much!
